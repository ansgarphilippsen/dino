TODO LIST FOR DINO

should be done sooner or later
==============================

XD grid format (external filter, split into ascii coord and binary grid file)

add -selection to attachment (pass pointer to select)

OpenDX scalar field format

cleanup stereo code (init ok, but flags and switching is badly hacked)

Gromacs trj support

crystallographic symmetry

hydrogen bonds (new nbond obj)

introduce temp object for simplified sytnax (aka rasmol)

This should be implemented / fixed asap
=======================================

support more than 20 models

get dials to work again on SGI

ensure shared version does not contain libGLcore.so

add property cp (rw) to scene

add scal.slab to pov output

re-implement scene spin

add flag to POVray output to write out untransformed coordinates

check PDB loading (esp multi-model)

check transparency for lines/contour (back/front sorting)

delete should accept wildcards

scene:lightN grab INPUTDEVICE

set labels on/off with command plus selection possible

write image file from scalar-field slab

struct restrc affects surf after attachment -> bug or feature ???

*??*relink against static motif on linux

*ALPHA*rewrite POV output to accept cgfx VA

*ALPHA*.dinorc

*ALPHA* add helix cylinders!

*WORKAROUND*fix argument passing in scripts

*WORKAROUND*round caps do not work with tuber!=1

*DIFFICULT* delay calculation of triangles for isocontours until 
  render fill is called for the first time!

*OK*add POVray v3.5

*OK*new picking not working -> back to old

*OK* only activate stereo visual on linux if "-stereo" is passed on command line

*OK*add range property "dist" that is distance in A from $CP
(-range prop=dist,val=0:100) to struct and surf ds

*OK*matrix extraction code broken !!!

*OK*geom objects not visible behind surface (drawing order)

*OK*.surf render light2 not working

*OK*filter dataset name to replace . with _

*OK*add range flag clamp to all ds (e.g surf)

*OK*allow underscore in vars

*OK*naming detail vs detail2

*OK*add flag to -range that will either clamp or ignore outside values

*OK* render bw=0 resp sr=0 should deactivate cyl resp sphere rendering

*OK*struct write should honor restriction

*OK*apply transformation to surface normals

*OK* transparent hsc == new coloring code

*OK* render intpol not working

*OK*check colors on SGI

*OK*automatic swapping

*OK*use -sel -select -selection

*DEPRECATED*use '-arch XXX' flag for load to identify architecture and to 
automatically decide wether to swap or not (MIPS ALPHA PPC INTEL and MSB 
and LSB)
