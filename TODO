TODO LIST FOR DINO

This should be implemented / fixed asap
=======================================

*ALPHA*.dinorc

scalar field dataset offset !!!!!!!

naming detail vs detail2

add flag to -range that will either clamp or ignore outside values

*ALPHA* add helix cylinders!

*OK* render bw=0 resp sr=0 should deactivate cyl resp sphere rendering

*DIFFICULT* delay calculation of triangles for isocontours until 
  render fill is called for the first time!

struct write should honor restriction

check POVray output

check PDB loading (esp multi-model)

apply transformation to surface normals

check transparency for lines/contour (back/front sorting)

*OK* transparent hsc == new coloring code

*OK* render intpol not working

check colors on SGI

delete should accept wildcards

new picking not working -> back to old

scene:lightN grab INPUTDEVICE

set labels on/off with command plus selection possible

use '-arch XXX' flag for load to identify architecture and to 
automatically decide wether to swap or not (MIPS ALPHA PPC INTEL and MSB 
and LSB)
 
relink against static motif on linux

rewrite POV output to accept cgfx VA

write image file from scalar-field slab

struct restrc affects surf after attachment -> bug or feature ???

*OK* use -sel -select -selection
