non-standard atom names no longer cause occasional crashes

coord dataset write command honors transformation

improved element determination from atom names in PDB files

"get center" command works for geom dataset

accum (-a) write now honors view settings

dataset transformation is now reflected in $CP

render is called after coord-obj set command

New Features (not really suitable for release candidates...)
------------------------------------------------------------

added GROMACS coordinate file ".gro" format

added scene parameter splitmode (0 per default for straight, 1 for cross-eye)

added -f flag to dino startup flags (fast load instead of -s), also works with @ command 


CHANGES FOR v0.8.6
==================

New Features
------------

added GROMACS xtc trajectory format

added spider scalar-field format

added surface curvature property 'curv' that ranges from -1.0 (all 
adjacent faces are concave) to 1.0 (all adjavent faces are convex)

shell / interpreter code re-written from scratch, in preparation for
TCL (or similar) scripting

GUI code mostly rewritten, graphical frontend is now completely
separated from backend, to facilitate porting to OSX (and _maybe_ MSWin)

added .dinorc file; currently supported are:

1) an exec block that contains commands to be executed upon startup, eg
exec {
  scene set bg=white
  scene set fov=40
}
2) flags dial_rot_scale, dial_trans_scale, mouse_rot_scale and
mouse_trans_scale to set the multiplication factor for these input devices, eg:
dial_rot_scale 0.5
dial_trans_scale 0.5

added new flag to generate POVray v3.5 output "-v35"

scene is centered on the first dataset that is loaded iff scene
transformation was not set previously (e.g. with a scene set rtc=...)

invalid chars in filenames are replaced with underscore upon loading
(allowd chars are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, - and _ )

added gz support to msms files (ie you can now have surf.vert.gz and
surf.face.gz) 

assignement of secondary structure based on HELIX and SHEET entries in
PDB file (no dssp-like algorithm implemented yet)

using '.ds.obj material' without parameters will show the current settings

for 'ds.obj render': detail1 is always amount of spherical/circular
subdivision (e.g. spheres for cpk, tube cross-section), detail2 is the
number of spline segments for spline/hsc/tube

mousewheel can be used to zoom

added '-range' parameter 'clamp' to assign all values smaller, resp
larger to first, resp second color, e.g.
.struct.obj set color=blue:red -range prop=bfac,val=30:80,clamp

tube diameter is now set with the render flag 'tubew' (not anymore with 'bw')

added render flag 'userad': this will cause the tube-radius (set with
'tubew') to be multiplied with the the CA atom radius, e.g.
.struct.trace set rad=0.5:2.0 -range prop=bfac,val=30:80,clamp
.struct.trace render tube,tubew=1.0,userad

scene property fogd renamed to fogo (fog offset), this is now an absolut value

added scene properties 'fogm' (fog method, one of 'linear' (default),
'exp' & 'exp2') and fogd (density for 'exp' and 'exp2' method)

depth effect is _off_ per default (turn on with 'scene set depthc')

added binpos format

removed raster3d output (use povray instead)

auto-detection of swapping for binary data (ie the -swap flag upon
load is no longer necessary)

'render' is automatically called after 'set' command for struct ds

added round caps to HSC and tube ends

added -c flag to uhbd load to convert units based on header scale

added -rn flag to surf load command, forcing a renormalization of the 
normal vectors

added scene command "rock" (toggles rocking motion on and off)

added ".dcd" as CHARMM trj extension

added startup flag "-noom" to avoid object menu being displayed

scene stack is now populated with coordinates rather than atom ids

added ruler (scene show ruler)

Bug Fixes
---------

scalar-field geometric center and center of rotation now identical

obj limitation for struct dataset removed

render nice/fast work for geom objects

fixed distance/angle/torsion bug

spaceball and dialbox should work again (even on linux)

geom object are now visible behind transparent objects

render light2 works again

fixed 'render !intpol' crash

fixed struct obj transparency

variables names may have - or _ in their name

mix/max should work now in -range flag

fixed hsc/tube crashes

'render sr=0' resp 'render bw=0' will deactivate sphere, resp cyl rendering

fixed 'degenerate cylinder error' in POVray output

reduced memory usage of scalar-field object by ~30%
