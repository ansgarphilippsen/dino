TODO list specific to the Cocoa distribution:
_____________________________________________

-Object menu.

-Keyboard input in Dino's OpenGL windows should be sent to the CLI.

-Custom menu (right mouse click in gfx window)

-CLI will always accept input if in foreground, not only if you explicitely click inside

-"set current directory" menu item that pops up a file-selector-box to change the
current working directory (which is "/" by default)

-"run script" menu item that pops up a file-selector-box so a script file can be selected (automatically changing into its directory)

-Improve write function.

-Implement the "Copy" function in the menu to directly copy/paste the gfx into photoshop or the like

-remove fprintf, use CLI instead.
