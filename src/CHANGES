added range flag clamp

diameter of tube determined by tubew, not bw

atom prop rad can be used to modify the hsc/tube rendering with render 
flag userad

rewrote shell code completely!

added startup file

added scene properties fogm (linear, exp exp2) and fogd (density) (not really
usable)

renamed scene property fogd to fogo (offset), fogo now absolute

added cylindrical helix rendering (helixm=1) ALPHA stage

mix/max should work now in -range flag

fixed hsc/tube crashes

render sr=0 resp bw=0 will deactivate sphere, resp cyl rendering

depth effect is off per default

fixed !intpol crash

fixed structure dataset object transparency

revamped GUI: separated layers, added GLUT/freeglut or SDL support

added binpos format

raster3D output removed

auto-detection of swapping for scalar field maps

fixed 'degenerate cylinder error' in POVray output

reduced memory usage of scalar-field object by ~30%

fixed atom-id picking bug

fixed beginning of hsc object error bug

---

render is called for struct obj after set

added round caps to HSC and tube ends

fixed bug in accum routine (enabled front buffer for reading), workaround 
for NVIDIA clearing accum buffer bug

fixed bug in cnsb routine

added -c flag to uhbd load to convert units based on header scale

added -rn flag to surf load command, forcing a renormalization of the 
normal vectors

added error-catch to contouring

added scalar-field dataset properties vm and vc

using AppPlusShell widget instead of normal one

topo may be asymmetric, scalexy is really scalex, ratio is maintained

-range bug fixed for scalar field dataset

MEAD .fld center bug fixed

motif lib (lesstif 1.2) linked statically under linux

corrected .struct write for hydrogen names >3 chars

added clipping planes 1-5

added -dump flag to write

added experimental feature render solid

fixed null pointer bug in dbmGetMinMax

circumvent bug in texture handling for slab + grid

added empty dropsite to use labels and shared LessTif lib

rtc added to struct ds

rot trans center rtc added to surf ds

.geom.geom set color=x  sets default obj color

render tube tube for geom points

rewrote POVray section, improved output, renamed '-new' to '-patch', added
'-nocolor', better megapov support

first implementation of scal-obj slab

first implementation of BDTRJ format

first (incomplete) implementation of struct-obj hbond

rewrote SGI stereo detection code (again)

fixed some problems with ADS format (buffer overflow) but triangle normal
determinations is still a problem (maybe should be rewritten with Delauny
triangulation ?)

fixed some problems with the spaceball under linux, still not working nicely,
though

fixed bug: '.struct write -type'

fixed bug: ESC chars work in (newer) linux xterms

fixed bug: ds creation for non-existent surface
