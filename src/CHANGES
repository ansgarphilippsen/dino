variable names may have - or _

new matrix/vector extraction code for tcl support

added gz support to msms files (FINALLY)

automatic assignement of secondary structure present in PDB file

calling material without parameter will dump the current settings

render detail1 is always circular/spherical subdivision, detail2 number of 
spline segments

mousewheel for zoom

added (experimental) usedlist prop to scene, causes all RENDER_CUSTOM 
modes to first generate a display list for faster rendering

added range flag clamp

diameter of tube determined by tubew, not bw

atom prop rad can be used to modify the hsc/tube rendering with render 
flag userad

rewrote shell code completely!
