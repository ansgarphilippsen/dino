fixed bug in cnsb routine

added -c flag to uhbd load to convert units based on header scale

added -rn flag to surf load command, forcing a renormalization of the 
normal vectors

added error-catch to contouring

added scalar-field dataset properties vm and vc

using AppPlusShell widget instead of normal one

topo may be asymmetric, scalexy is really scalex, ratio is maintained

-range bug fixed for scalar field dataset

MEAD .fld center bug fixed

motif lib (lesstif 1.2) linked statically under linux

corrected .struct write for hydrogen names >3 chars

added clipping planes 1-5

added -dump flag to write

added experimental feature render solid

fixed null pointer bug in dbmGetMinMax

circumvent bug in texture handling for slab + grid

added empty dropsite to use labels and shared LessTif lib

rtc added to struct ds

rot trans center rtc added to surf ds

.geom.geom set color=x  sets default obj color

render tube tube for geom points

rewrote POVray section, improved output, renamed '-new' to '-patch', added
'-nocolor', better megapov support

first implementation of scal-obj slab

first implementation of BDTRJ format

first (incomplete) implementation of struct-obj hbond

rewrote SGI stereo detection code (again)

fixed some problems with ADS format (buffer overflow) but triangle normal
determinations is still a problem (maybe should be rewritten with Delauny
triangulation ?)

fixed some problems with the spaceball under linux, still not working nicely,
though

fixed bug: '.struct write -type'

fixed bug: ESC chars work in (newer) linux xterms

fixed bug: ds creation for non-existent surface
