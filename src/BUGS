current problems
----------------

set color1=xxx,color2=yyy,color3=zzz will use only zzz as all colors

picking doesn't work after resize

explicit colors broken

within selection cannot distinguish between several values and vector (TCL)

cpk not written to file (display list problem)



known problems for DINO v0.8.5
------------------------------

- surface normals wrong after fix

- offline rendering context textures not working

- surface dataset restriction not working

- NMR multi-model files take too long to load

- scalar-field type contour transparency has problems detecting front-to-back

- alternate model char in PDB format not working

- picking in split scene does not work

- MEAD coordinate file does not recognize atom types, ie all atoms white

- surface solid rendering can be VERY slow on linux machines using only a 
  software stencil buffer

- orthographic rendering broken

- PostScript output crashes when using labels

- .struct.obj render hsc,detail=1 will coredump (use detail > 1)

- occasional crashes on the SGIs when moving the scene with the mouse. This
  seems to be a bug in the X-windows event handling. FIX: turn off all object
  before moving, rotate the scene (left-click and move mouse some), then turn
  objects back on

- writing pics larger than the current screen size might not scale
  correctly under linux

- POVray output only partial for geom objects

- POVray output only renders filled triangles for surface and topo objects
