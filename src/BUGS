known problems for DINO v0.8.4
------------------------------

- surface normals wrong after fix

- offline rendering context textures not working

- surface dataset restriction not working

- NMR multi-model files take too long to load

- scalar-field type contour transparency has problems detecting front-to-back

- struct obj transparency not working

- alternate model char in PDB format not working

- picking in split scene does not work

- MEAD coordinate file does not recognize atom types, ie all atoms white

- render !intpol coredumps

- surface solid rendering can be VERY slow on linux machines using only a 
  software stencil buffer

- orthographic rendering broken

- PostScript output crashes when using labels

- .struct.obj render hsc,detail=1 will coredump (use detail > 1)

- occasional crashes on the SGIs when moving the scene with the mouse. This
  seems to be a bug in the X-windows event handling. FIX: turn off all object
  before moving, rotate the scene (left-click and move mouse some), then turn
  objects back on

- writing pics larger than the current screen size might not scale
  correctly under linux

- offscreen rendering on linux might missmatches graphics display, use
  -dump option of write as workaround

- POVray output only partial for geom objects

- POVray output only renders filled triangles for surface and topo objects

- on weird scalar fields insane memory usage possible
