known problems for DINO v0.8.4
------------------------------

- surface solid rendering can be VERY slow on linux machines using only a 
  software stencil buffer

- orthographic rendering broken

- PostScript outout crashes when using labels

- .struct.obj render hsc,detail=1 will coredump (use detail > 1)

- rigid body transformation properties not uniquely named (eg center + rcen)

- occasional crashes on the SGIs when moving the scene with the mouse. This
  seems to be a bug in the X-windows event handling. FIX: turn off all object
  before moving, rotate the scene (left-click and move mouse some), then turn
  objects back on

- writing pics larger than the current screen size will not scale
  correctly under linux

- TIFF not compressed (use PNG)

- offscreen rendering on linux missmatches graphics display, use
  -dump option of write

- POVray output only partial for geom objects

- POVray output only renders filled triangles for surface and topo objects

- accumulation (-a) flag of write does not work
